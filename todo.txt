- Ensure runtime name does not exist
- Add newline at the end of file of scripts in case they don't exist
- Load runtimes into cache on startup
- Delete runtimes (maybe from database only)
- Make installation acquire normal semaphore as well (and add the reasoning to presentation) or stop everything when installing
- If nix gets re-installed, nix-profile becomes bad (no reproducibility)
  - Prepare the real value in Dockerfile
- Nix runtimes will be inconsistent if we use non-deterministic nix channels and a worker gets added after a nix channel was updated
  - Disable nix channels
- Use anyhow instead of error string
- Proper logging
