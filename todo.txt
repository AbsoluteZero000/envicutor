- Delete runtimes (maybe from database and cache only)
- Make running acquire installation semaphore (and add reasoning to presentation)
- Nix runtimes will be inconsistent if we use non-deterministic nix channels and a worker gets added after a nix channel was updated
  - Disable nix channels
- Use anyhow instead of error string
- Proper logging

- How to test stuff that happen at startup?
