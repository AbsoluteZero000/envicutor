- nix-shell command needs to be accessible inside sandbox
- Test
- Ensure runtime name does not exist
- Load runtimes into cache on startup
- Delete runtimes (maybe from database only)
- Make installation acquire normal semaphore as well (and add the reasoning to presentation) or stop everything when installing
- Who provides files?
  - Provide main file name on server
  - Note: if you have multiple files then you are probably aware of the programming language being used
- Nix runtimes will be inconsistent if we use non-deterministic nix channels and a worker gets added after a nix channel was updated
  - Disable nix channels
- Proper logging
- Use anyhow instead of error string

- Suggested architecture
  - Directory containing runtime ids
    - compile_script (if any)
    - run_script
    - env
    - shell.nix
    - metadata (to be stored in memory, Judge0 stores them in a database)

- Directories to create in Docker container
  - /envicutor/runtimes
