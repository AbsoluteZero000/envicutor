- List runtimes
- Delete runtimes (maybe from database and cache only)
- Make installation acquire normal semaphore as well (and add the reasoning to presentation) or make running acquire installation semaphore
- If nix gets re-installed, nix-profile becomes bad (no reproducibility)
  - Prepare the real value in Dockerfile
- Nix runtimes will be inconsistent if we use non-deterministic nix channels and a worker gets added after a nix channel was updated
  - Disable nix channels
- Use anyhow instead of error string
- Proper logging

- How to test stuff that happen at startup?
