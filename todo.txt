- Use isolate mount instead of copying into box to avoid escalating with sudo
- Use isolate volume to mount nix store R/W
- Clean up after errors
- Ensure name does not exist
- Load runtimes into cache on startup
- Delete runtimes (maybe from database only)
- Ensure all boxes are cleaned on startup?
- Who provides files?
  - Provide main file name on server
  - Note: if you have multiple files then you are probably aware of the programming language being used
- Use clippy
- Nix runtimes will be inconsistent if we use non-deterministic nix channels and a worker gets added after a nix channel was updated
  - Disable nix channels

- Suggested architecture
  - Directory containing runtime ids
    - compile_script (if any)
    - run_script
    - env
    - shell.nix
    - metadata (to be stored in memory, Judge0 stores them in a database)
