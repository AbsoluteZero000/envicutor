  - Opt 1: move into isolate before cleaning up
    - Drawbacks
      - Performance loss if /tmp and /var are on different file systems
      - Inability to clean up if dir is created while another one with the same name exists
        - Or at initial startup
  - Opt 2: setuid script to remove submission dir
    - Drawbacks
      - Needs to be secure and stored in a directory that is not accessible to the sandbox
  - Opt 3: re-adjusting limits based on compilation metrics
    - Drawbacks
      - Depending on undefined isolate behavior
- Test that installation is stopped if there are running processes
- Test that installation is stopped if there is a running installation
- Limit tests
- Proper logging
