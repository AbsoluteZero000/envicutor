- Test setting invalid limits
- Test stuff that happen at startup
  - Need to stop and start envicutor
  - Need to run envicutor on the same tests that check the existing runtimes and run simple code

  - Don't do splitting logic in docker entrypoint, but in makefile
  - Stop and start envicutor after the split that checks simple code and runtimes and restart that split
- Proper logging
- More limit tests
