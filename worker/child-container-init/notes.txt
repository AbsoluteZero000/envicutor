- Nix store on worker and clean up each time vs nix store in overlay?
  - Use Nix store in overlay for isolation
    - Submissions can communicate with each other if we have a shared nix store
- Master worker
  - Has access to the network that contains the submission database
- Slave worker
  - Only has network access to the cache server and the master worker
