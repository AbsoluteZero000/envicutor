- Type aliases or better struct field names to specify the units in StageConstraints
- Conduct an experiment that shows the communication between the child container in the worker and the cache server
  - Sysbox in the kubernetes architecture
  - A container with docker installed (container A)
  - A container serving at some port (container B)
  - Create a child container in container A and try to send a request to container B from the child

- How to isolate network in nsjail while still having internet access?
  - Clone appropriate macvlan, do that instead of -n
    - How to find out the network interface to clone?
      - Define the network interface name while creating the docker container, clone this network interface name in
        nsjail?
  - Separate the worker into worker master and worker slave
    - Worker slave is the one which runs the code
    - It only has network access to the worker master and to the cache server
    - How do we connect between master and slave?
      - Websockets?
        - Can the response be faked from within the container in the slave?
    - Does cloning a network in nsjail ensure we have access to the other hosts on the network?
  - Experiment with multiple docker networks
- What is the problem?
  - Nsjail should have
    - Internet access
    - Access to the cache server
  - Worker container should have
    - Internet access
    - Access to the cache server
    - Access to the in memory database
    - Access to the database
    - Access to the request handler
  - Nsjail shouldn't access the last two
    - So we can't use the network interfaces from the child container in nsjail (-N) since extra stuff will be cloned

- Report resource consumption
	- Because we are wrapping inside of nsjail, we can't get the exit signal properly
    - Use time to get the exit signal?
      - Time does not get the exit signal
	- Nsjail really_quiet
- Explain some(), unwrap(), take()
- Fix to_string
- Str, string optimizations
- Remove unwraps
  - Handle no exit signal
- Parse cmd opts
- Talk about question mark
- Credit sandkasten
- Mount more stuff
- Notify about limits violated
- Add file descriptors to limits (docs)
- Add networking to limits (docs)
