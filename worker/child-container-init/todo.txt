- How to isolate network in nsjail while still having internet access?
  - Clone appropriate macvlan, do that instead of -N
    - How to find out the network interface to clone?
      - Define the network interface name while creating the Docker container, clone this network interface name in
        nsjail?
  - separate the worker into worker master and worker slave
    - worker slave is the one which runs the code
    - it only has network access to the worker master and to the cache server
  - Experiment with multiple docker networks
- what is the problem?
  - nsjail should have
    - internet access
    - access to the cache server
  - child container should have
    - internet access
    - access to the cache server
    - access to the in memory database
    - access to the database
    - access to the request handler
  - nsjail shouldn't access the last two
    - so we can't use the network interfaces from the child container in nsjail (-N) since extra stuff will be cloned

- Report resource consumption
	- Because we are wrapping inside of nsjail, we can't get the exit signal properly
    - Use time to get the exit signal?
      - time does not get the exit signal
	- nsjail really_quiet
- Explain Some(), unwrap(), take()
- Fix to_string
- str, String optimizations
- Remove unwraps
  - Handle no exit signal
- Parse cmd opts
- Talk about question mark
- Credit Sandkasten
- Mount more stuff
- Notify about limits violated
- Add file descriptors to limits (docs)
- Add networking to limits (docs)
